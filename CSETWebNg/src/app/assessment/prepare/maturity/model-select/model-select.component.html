        The Capability Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) measures
        cybersecurity maturity with five levels and aligns a set of processes and
        practices with the type and sensitivity of information to be protected
        and the associated range of threats. The model consists of maturity
        processes and cybersecurity best practices from multiple
        cybersecurity standards, frameworks and other references,
        as well as inputs from the broader community.

<p><strong>DFARS&nbsp;252.204-7012&nbsp;Interim Rule: Effective Date November 30, 2020</strong>
  <br /> On September 29, 2020, the DoD is issued an interim rule to amend the Defense Federal 
  Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement a DoD Assessment Methodology and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
   (CMMC) framework in order to assess contractor implementation of cybersecurity requirements and enhance the protection of
    unclassified information within the DoD supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>CMMC Rollout phased over five years</strong><br /> DoD is implementing a phased rollout of CMMC. Until September 30, 2025 a
   clause affecting the CMMC Requirements is prescribed for use in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12
    procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, excluding acquisitions exclusively for COTS items, if the requirement document or statement of work 
    requires a contractor to have a specific CMMC level.</p>
